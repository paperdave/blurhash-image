# ultra minified blurhash-image

this is a fork of a project to create a custom `blurhash-image` element that allows for easy embedding of [blurhashes](https://blurha.sh/) on the web. the idea is you inline the script with your html, and javascript generates the image displayed, which runs **before** the first paint.

in davecode.net, i use this technique with server side rendering and client side svelte, where this element is rendered, but once the client javascript is loaded the real image is displayed.

note that this is **only** the blurhash component and doesn't handle displaying your actual image, it also may not be 100% color-accurate to your real blurhash, though any difference is too minor to notice with your eye.

## install

because this is intended to be embedded into EVERY page, i wanted it to be as small as possible, so i present a manual assisted **1088 byte** minification. it's on npm, or inside of blurhash-image.min.js, or pasted below

```sh
npm install blurhash-image
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```{class e extends HTMLElement{connectedCallback(e,t=12,a=255,s=.055,r=1+s,{max:n,min:i,PI:c,cos:l,round:m,sign:o}=Math,d=(e=>[...e].reduce(((e,t)=>83*e+"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz#$%*+,-.:;=?@[]^_{|}~".indexOf(t)),0)),h=this.getAttribute("blurhash"),u=document.createElement("canvas"),b=u.getContext("2d"),g=d(h[0]),f=1+(g/9|0),p=g%9+1,x=(d(h[1])+1)/166,C=[],k=new Uint8Array(256),y=0,A=b.createImageData(8,u.width=u.height=8),D,E,I,v){for(v=0;v<p*f;v++)(C[v]=v?(e=d(h.slice(4+2*v,6+2*v)),[e/361|0,(e/19|0)%19,e%19].map((e=>(e-9)/9)).map((e=>o(e)*e**2*x))):(e=d(h.slice(2,6)),[e>>16,e>>8&a,e&a].map((n=>(e=n/a)<=.4?e/t:((e+s)/r)**2.4))))[3]=1;for(D=0;D<8;D++)for(E=0;E<8;E++){for(e=[0,0,0,1],I=0;I<f;I++)for(v=0;v<p;v++)e=e.map(((e,t)=>e+C[v+I*p][t]*l(c*E*v/8)*l(c*D*I/8)));e.map((c=>k[y++]=(e=n(0,i(1,c)),m((e<=1/319?e*t:r*e**.41-s)*a+.5))))}A.data.set(k),this.style.background=`url(${u.toDataURL(b.putImageData(A,0,0))})0 0/100%`}attributeChangedCallback(e,t,a){a||(this[e]=t)}}e.observedAttributes=["style"],customElements.define("blurhash-image",e)}```

Remember, it's intended to be INLINED to be run BEFORE all other javascript, not imported in a giant application. so you will notice that `import`ing the npm version gives you the script as a string, which is handy for templates and build scripts. [Here's how I embed it in my website](https://github.com/davecaruso/davecode.net/blob/f18c382f8b9bfe81474eb637701edfeb7b9e5f4a/svelte.config.js#L17-L23).

```ts
const blurhashImageScript = require("blurhash-image"); // returns a string

import blurhashImageScript from "blurhash-image"; // default import is a string
```

You of course can also just read `node_modules/blurhash-image/blurhash-image.min.js.` and inline that.

## usage

when using, you simply just include this in your markup:

```html
<blurhash-image blurhash="LKO2?U%2Tw=w]~RBVZRi};RPxuwH"></blurhash-image>
```

note that this only generates the image itself, and you will need to add your own styles to make it the right size and aspect ratio. see the `width`, `height` and `aspect-ratio` css properties.

- simple usage example in svelte: [my old BlurHash.svelte component](https://github.com/paperdave/paperdave.net/blob/f18c382f8b9bfe81474eb637701edfeb7b9e5f4a/src/lib/components/BlurHash.svelte), which handles displaying the canvas and swapping to the real image once it loads.
- advanced example: [the `Img.svelte` component on paperdave.net](https://github.com/paperdave/paperdave.net/blob/4b461f299cb87a43fa1bd828fffb6c57fc163dc4/src/lib/components/Img.svelte). I edited my initial implementation to handle a lot more things; however the old component is good for learning how to use `blurhash-image`, but this component is more full and handles all my personal needs. It uses a custom encoding for the image urls so that they can embed aspect ratios, the blurhash string, and the url, in almost less text that the expanded url alone would actually be (For example `e1501dacd5986dd333f58f7901e90e31/4/L5D,Q3Ey,Mbd|QwJFUxD5}JQ#@bJ`). Leaving this component for any inspiration on how blurhashes can be pushed to the limit.

## further minification

if you want to, go ahead; tell me if you get it any smaller without losing functionality, that would be cool. in a sort of way, this is a fun code golfing challenge, but with an actual use. ... well beyond this point saves no percivable time, but its fun to think about.
